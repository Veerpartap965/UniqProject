    <h1><u>Sant jarnail singh ji bhindrawale</u></h1>
    <img src="Jarnail_Singh_Bhindranwale.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale  born Jarnail Singh Brar;[4] 2 June 1947[5]– 6 June 1984) was a Sikh militant.[6][7][8] After Operation Bluestar, he posthumously became the leading figure for the Khalistan movement,[12] although he did not personally advocate for a separate Sikh nation.[13][14][15][16][17]

He was the fourteenth jathedar or leader, of the prominent orthodox Sikh religious institution Damdami Taksal.[18][19] An advocate of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution,[20][21][22][14] he gained significant attention after his involvement in the 1978 Sikh-Nirankari clash. In the summer of 1982, Bhindranwale and the Akali Dal launched the Dharam Yudh Morcha ("righteous campaign"),[23] with its stated aim being the fulfilment of a list of demands based on the Anandpur Sahib Resolution to create a largely autonomous state within India. Thousands of people joined the movement in the hope of retaining a larger share of irrigation water and the return of Chandigarh to Punjab.[24] There was dissatisfaction in some sections of the Sikh community with prevailing economic, social, and political conditions.[25] Over time Bhindranwale grew to be a leader of Sikh militancy.[26][27]

In 1982, Bhindranwale and his group moved to the Golden Temple complex and made it his headquarters. Bhindranwale would establish what amounted to a "parallel government" in Punjab,[28][29] settling cases and resolving disputes,[28][30][31] while conducting his campaign.[32] In 1983, he along with his militant cadre inhabited and fortified the Sikh shrine Akal Takht. In June 1984, Operation Blue Star was carried out by the Indian Army to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib in the Golden Temple Complex,[33] which resulted in hundreds to thousands of deaths according to various reports, including that of Bhindranwale.
Bhindranwale has remained a controversial figure in Indian history.[35] While the Sikhs' highest temporal authority Akal Takht describe him a 'Martyr',[36] with immense appeal among rural sections of the Sikh population,[29][37] who saw him as a powerful leader,[37] who stood up to Indian state dominance and repression,[38][39] many Indians saw him as spearheading a "revivalist, extremist and terrorist movement",[37][40][41][42][43][contradictory] which remains a point of contention.[21][22][44]</p>
<h1>Early life</h1>
<hr>
<p>Bhindranwale was born on 2 June 1947 as Jarnail Singh Brar to a Jat Sikh family, in the village of Rode,[3] in Moga District (then a part of Ferozepur district),[51] located in the region of Malwa.[1] The grandson of Sardar Harnam Singh Brar, his father, Joginder Singh Brar was a farmer and a local Sikh leader, and his mother was Nihal Kaur.[4] Jarnail Singh was the seventh of eight siblings of seven brothers and one sister.[52] He was put into a school in 1953 at the age of 6 but he dropped out of school five years later to work with his father on the farm.[53]</p>
<h1>View on Khalistan</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Bhindranwale never supported Khalistan or separation from India,[264] was not an outspoken supporter of Khalistan,[58] and never demanded it,[17][50] although he often emphasized the separate identity of the Sikhs.[58] Bhindranwale stated his position on Khalistan, a movement which was first introduced in concept during the 1946 independence negotiations.[265] During interviews with domestic and foreign journalists and public speeches through his phrase that "Sikh ik vakhri qaum hai" (or, "Sikhism is a distinct nation"),[91] using the word 'Qaum' (nation, people, or also religion) when referring to the Sikh population of Punjab,[266] though others have argued that "national" is a mistranslation of 'qaum,' as India was a nation of various races and 'qaums.' In a speech given by Bhindranwale on 27 March 1983:

I stayed ten days in Delhi. There I too was asked, just as they ask me here all the time when friends from the newspaper come, [They ask] "Sant Ji, do you want Khalistan?’ I replied; “Brothers, I don't oppose it nor do I support it. We are silent. However, one thing is definite, if this time the Queen of India does give it to us, we shall certainly take it. We won't reject it. We shall not repeat the mistake of 1947. As yet, we do not ask for it. It is Indira Gandhi's business and not mine, nor Longowal's, nor of any other of our leaders. It is Indira's business, Indira should tell us whether she wants to keep us in Hindustan or not. We like to live together [with the rest of Indians]; we like to live in India.”[246][267][115][268]

While Bhindranwale never explicitly supported Khalistan,[269] in a BBC interview, he stated that if the government agreed to the creation of such a state, he would not refuse and repeat the mistakes made by Sikh leadership during the 1946 independence: “How can a nation which has sacrificed so much for the freedom of the country want it fragmented but I shall definitely say that we are not in favor of Khalistan nor are we against it.”[269][270] adding that the Sikhs would opt for a separate state only if they were discriminated against and were not respected in India, or if their distinct Sikh identity was in any way threatened.[58] In regards to the idea of the Indian government attacking the Darbar Sahib, he stated, "if the Indian Government invaded the Darbar Sahib complex, the foundation for an independent Sikh state will have been laid."[271]

In his final interview to Subhash Kirpekar, Bhindranwale stated that "Sikhs can neither live in India nor with India. If treated as equals it may be possible. But frankly speaking I don't think that is possible."[272] Kuldip Brar, who would later head Operation Blue Star, would subsequently put forth that per the Indian intelligence sources in early June 1984, there was a "strong feeling" and "some sort of information" among the government that Bhindranwale was supposedly planning to declare Khalistan an independent country any moment with support from Pakistan, that Khalistani currency had allegedly already been distributed, and that this declaration would have increased chances of Punjab Police and security personnel siding with Bhindranwale.[273]

In later disclosures from former R&AW special secretary G.B.S. Sidhu, R&AW itself helped "build the Khalistan legend," actively participated in the planning of Operation Blue Star. While posted in Ottawa, Canada in 1976 to look into the "Khalistan problem" among the Sikh diaspora, Sidhu found "nothing amiss" during the three years he was there,[21] stating that "Delhi was unnecessarily making a mountain of a molehill where none existed," that the agency created seven posts in West Europe and North America in 1981 to counter non-existent Khalistan activities, and that the deployed officers were "not always familiar with the Sikhs or the Punjab issue."[21] Describing the secessionist movement as a "chimera" until the attack on the Darbar Sahib, after which the insurgency would start,[21] he would later contend that:

Bhindranwale never raised the demand for Khalistan or went beyond the Akali Anandpur Sahib Resolution, while he himself was prepared for negotiations to the very end. All talks with the more moderate Akalis had already failed. The hawks had taken control of Mrs Gandhi and so the worst was to happen and the Sikhs never forgave her for what happened.[21]

According to a New York Times article written just a few weeks after the operation:

Before the raid on the Golden Temple, neither the Government nor anyone else appeared to put much credence in the Khalistan movement. Mr. Bhindranwale himself said many times that he was not seeking an independent country for Sikhs, merely greater autonomy for Punjab within the Indian Union....One possible explanation advanced for the Government's raising of the Khalistan question is that it needs to take every opportunity to justify the killing in Amritsar and the invasion of the Sikhs' holiest shrine.[22]

Khushwant Singh had written that "considerable Khalistan sentiment seems to have arisen since the raid on the temple, which many Sikhs, if not most, have taken as a deep offense to their religion and their sensibilities," referring to the drastic change in community sentiments after the army attack.[22] According to former member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly Inderjit Singh Jaijee,

"So much anxiety was created about Bhindranwale and his men. They were called antinational even though Bhindranwale had always maintained he was not asking for Khalistan, but if the government wanted to push that as the only solution, he would take it. … 
The government meticulously set the stage. It was not him."[274]</p>
<h1>Death</h1>
<hr>
<p>In June 1984, after the negotiations, Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi ordered Operation Blue Star, an Indian Army operation carried out between 1 and 8 June 1984, to remove Bhindranwale and his armed militants from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex in Amritsar, Punjab.[275] Bhindranwale was killed in the operation.[276][277] Army officers and soldiers commented on 'the courage and commitment' of the followers of Bhindranwale who died in action;[278] General J. S. Aurora, who had been the commanding officer of two of the operation's commanding officers, would admit that the militants had "taken every advantage of their defensive positions, and fought valiantly and skillfully."[199]

Army action in the Punjab, which had been discussed as early as December 1983 to consolidate Hindu votes for Congress, began on 3 June, the day of Longowal's planned morcha.[220] Punjab's borders were sealed off and intrastate movement was disabled by the troop presence, with the water and electricity supply to the Golden Temple cut off. Exploratory fire was attempted on 4 June, with army commandos and CS gas proving ineffective on 5 June. The use of tanks on the complex began on 6 June, with tanks, helicopters, and other means used to deter the thousands of upset villagers attempting to gather in Amritsar,[278][279] along with any other attempted gathering at over 125 other gurdwaras which had been taken over preemptively by the state.[278] The main action was concluded by 6 June, in which a large number of pilgrims, including women and children, had been killed, and young men shot, by incensed troops who had entered the complex, with their hands tied back with their own turbans, with others dying of suffocation in the guest rooms set up as detainment camps.[278] The operation resulted in 700 army casualties and 5,000 civilian deaths.[278][280]

According to Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, who commanded the operation, the body of Bhindranwale was identified by a number of agencies, including the police, the Intelligence Bureau and militants in the Army's custody.[276] Bhindranwale's brother also identified Bhindranwale's body.[281][53] Pictures of what appear to be Bhindranwale's body have been published in at least two widely circulated books, Tragedy of Punjab: Operation Bluestar and After and Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi's Last Battle. BBC correspondent Mark Tully also reported seeing Bhindranwale's body during his funeral.[citation needed]

In 2016, The Week quoted former members of the confidential Special Group (SG) of India's Research and Analysis Wing as stating that SG had killed Bhindranwale using AK-47 rifles during Operation Blue Star, despite the Para SF claiming responsibility for it.[282]</p>
